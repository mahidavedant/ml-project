# Student Performance Indicator

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict student performance based on various factors such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, and test preparation course completion. The model will predict math, reading, and writing scores of students, which can be used to assess their academic performance.

## Life Cycle of Machine Learning Project
1. Understanding the Problem Statement
2. Data Collection
3. Data Checks to Perform
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Data Pre-Processing
6. Model Training
7. Choose Best Model

## Dataset Information
The dataset contains the following columns:
- Gender: Sex of students (Male/Female)
- Race/Ethnicity: Ethnicity of students (Group A, B, C, D, E)
- Parental Level of Education: Parents' final education (Bachelor's degree, Some college, Master's degree, Associate's degree, High school)
- Lunch: Whether the student had lunch before the test (Standard or Free/reduced)
- Test Preparation Course: Completion status of the test preparation course (Complete or Not complete)
- Math Score
- Reading Score
- Writing Score

## Data Checks to Perform
1. Check Missing Values
2. Check Duplicates
3. Check Data Types
4. Check the Number of Unique Values of Each Column
5. Check Statistics of Dataset
6. Check Various Categories Present in Different Categorical Columns

## Model Training
### 1. Import Data and Required Packages
Importing Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Warnings Library.
